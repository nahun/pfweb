# pfweb

pfweb is a python web application to manage the OpenBSD Packet Filter (PF). It 
uses *py-pf* to interface with PF and Flask for the web framework. The look 
and feel is based on pfSense and a lot of the ideas are ripped off from them.

## Warning!
I'm quite confident most (or all) OpenBSD developers would say running a web 
interface for PF is a bad bad idea. There are many reasons why, but here are a 
couple good ones:

- **Security**: Running pfweb requires the user running the application to have
access to */dev/pf* to make changes.
- **Features**: When using a web application to manage PF instead of 
just modifying *pf.conf*, you lose massive amounts of powerful features and 
flexibility.

So why would use you use pfweb? Maybe a home network or an already secured lab.
I don't judge though, use it how you want. I've had fun making it as well.

### Development

As of Nov 2016 pfweb is under initial development. Use at your own risk.

Right now the PF config is not persistant across reboots. It does not store 
rules configured yet, only in the active PF config. The plan is to use Pickle 
or something similar.

## Dependencies

- [OpenBSD 6.0+](http://www.openbsd.org/): Only tested on OpenBSD 6.0 amd64
- [py-pf](http://www.kernel-panic.it/software/py-pf/): Python module for 
managing OpenBSD's Packet Filter
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/): A microframework for Python based on 
Werkzeug and Jinja 2
- [Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/): User session management 
for Flask

## Installation

Installation under a virtualenv will work fine.

pfweb utilizes the well written 
[py-pf module](http://www.kernel-panic.it/software/py-pf/). The version in 
PyPi is not up to date so you'll need to clone from the 
[py-pf github repo](https://github.com/dotpy/py-pf) and install.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dotpy/py-pf.git
$ cd py-pf
$ python setup.py install
```

pfweb is under heavy development right now, so it is probably best to clone 
from github. First install Flask and Flask-Login then install pfweb.

```sh
$ pip install Flask flask-login
$ git clone https://github.com/nahun/pfweb.git
$ cd pfweb
$ python setup.py install
```

Or if the version on PyPi is actually current you can use pip:

```sh
$ pip install pfweb
```

## Setup

After installation, you'll have to decide how you want to run it. There are 
many options for python web applications such as FastCGI, mod_wsgi, uWSGI, 
etc... You can refer to 
[Flask's documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/deploying/#deployment) 
for more detail, but this guide will concentrate on FastCGI, flup, and 
OpenBSD's httpd

### Install flup

You'll need to install [flup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup/1.0.2), the 
FastCGI server:

```sh
$ pip install flup
```

### Create the FastCGI Server

Then you need to create a FastCGI server file such as *pfweb.fcgi*:

```python
from flup.server.fcgi import WSGIServer
from pfweb.pfweb import app

if __name__ == '__main__':
    WSGIServer(app, bindAddress='/var/www/run/pfweb.sock').run()
```

Make sure the socket file path is in httpd's chroot of /var/www otherwise 
httpd won't be able to read it.

### Setup httpd

Setup `/etc/httpd.conf` to use the fastcgi socket and listen on your IP. Edit 
the certificate paths with your own.

```
domain="example.com"

server $domain {
    listen on 1.2.3.4 port 80
    block return 301 "https://$SERVER_NAME$REQUEST_URI"
}

server $domain {
    listen on 1.2.3.4 tls port 443
    fastcgi socket "/run/pfweb.sock"

    tls {
        certificate "/etc/ssl/example.com.crt"
        key "/etc/ssl/private/example.com.key"
    }
}
```

Remember, httpd runs in a chroot under /var/www so set your fastcgi socket 
accordingly.

### PF Permissions

You'll need to give a user access to /dev/pf so we don't run anything as root. 
Create or use whichever group you want, we'll use *pfweb*. Also make sure the 
user running your webserver and FastCGI server is a member of that group.

```
# chown root:pfweb /dev/pf
# chmod g+rw /dev/pf
```

### Create a Config File

Now lets create the config file and username and password used to login to 
pfweb. The *pfweb.ini* file can exist at:

- Your current working directory
- /etc/pfweb.ini
- /usr/local/etc/pfweb.ini

pfweb will choose from that order. There are two required parameters that you 
must set manually, the Flask *secret_key* used in sessions and a *salt* to hash 
the password we'll be setting for authentication. Create the pfweb.ini with 
random strings used for these two parameters.

```ini
[main]
secret_key = longrandomstring
salt = anotherrandomstring
```

### Create a Username and Password

There are a few ways we can accomplish creating the username and password:

#### 1. Use `create_user.py`

The script is distributed in the package so you will need to find it in your 
installation or just [download](create_user.py?raw=true) it from the 
repo.

```sh
$ python create_user.py
Enter username: admin
Enter Password:
Confirm Password:
User tester created successfully
```

#### 2. pfweb Config() manually

You can import the pfweb Config object and create the credentials manually:

```python
>>> from pfweb.config import Config
>>> c = Config()
>>> c.create_user('your_username', 'your_password')
```

#### 3. Manually hash your password

Using python you can hash your password and enter it in manually to the config 
file. This will hash the password the same way the Config.create_user() method 
does.

```python
>>> import hashlib, binascii
>>> salt='your_salt'
>>> password='your_password'
>>> dk = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode(), salt.encode(), 100000)
>>> binascii.hexlify(dk)
'26383a0418be31cb6906418b367e19eb404cb8296e8f03521244b21cc079b82c'
```

Copy that hash and paste it into your config file with your username:

```ini
[main]
secret_key = longrandomstring
salt = anotherrandomstring
username = admin
password = 26383a0418be31cb6906418b367e19eb404cb8296e8f03521244b21cc079b82c
```

### Run the servers

Run the FastCGI server and (re)start httpd. The httpd_flags="" command is 
obviously optional if you already have it running. Make sure to run the 
FastCGI server as the correct user that has access to PF.
```sh
$ python pfweb.fcgi
```

```
# echo httpd_flags="" >> /etc/rc.conf.local
# rcctl restart httpd
```

You should now be able be able to reach pfweb in your browser

## Considerations

### FastCGI Process Managers

Just as the 
[Flask docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/deploying/fastcgi/#running-fastcgi-processes) 
say, you may want to use a process manager for your FastCGI server.
[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#fcgi-program-x-section-settings) 
works and OpenBSD has a package. Install with `pkg_add supervisor` then create 
a config file at `/etc/supervisord.d/pfweb.ini`

```ini
[fcgi-program:pfweb]
socket=unix:///var/www/run/pfweb.sock
command=/path/to/python /path/to/pfweb.fcgi
socket_owner=www
user=www
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
numprocs=5
autostart=true
autorestart=true
```

Edit `/etc/supervisord.conf` and uncomment the two lines at the end:

```ini
[include]
files = supervisord.d/*.ini
```

Restart supervisord and you should be good to go.
